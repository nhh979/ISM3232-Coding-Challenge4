# Coding Challenge 4

Through the assignment, we explore the inheritance in object-oriented programming by extending a `Car` class to create an `EV` class with additional properties and methods. Additionally, we discover the concept of method overriding which illustrates how the code of the method in the parent class can be replaced by that of the child class.

You can find the assignment in the `cc_j4.js` file.
